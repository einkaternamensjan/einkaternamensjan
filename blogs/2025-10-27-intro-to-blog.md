## Intro to Blog
Hello,
If you’re reading this then you’ve either come here deliberately or somehow stumbled upon this page unknowingly. Nonetheless I hope there will be something of interest to be found here. As of writing this introduction to this blog I believe my aim here is mainly to take my ideas and be able to express them in a sharper but also more meaningful way than I could otherwise. I have no intention of using this purely to strengthen my own views, but rather to expose these thoughts or ideas to the world and see what kind of feedback they receive. Without this one runs the risk of becoming so entrenched in one’s own views that it leads to nothing but dogmatism and furthermore blind ignorance. I can’t promise a consistent schedule for my posts, unfortunately some things take considerably longer to write than others, but I do plan to try and keep this semi-regular. As of yet I have no comment function to receive feedback, but I will try and add one soon, I can't imagine it being too difficult. Some posts may vary between German and English, I find some things easier to formulate in different languages, hopefully the translation function continues to work, but I will always provide the original language of the text so it’s clear to see which one has been translated.
