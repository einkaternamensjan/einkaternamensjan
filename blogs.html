Nonetheless I hope there will be something of interest to be found here. As of writing this introduction to this blog, my aim here is mainly to take my ideas and be able to express them in a clearer but also more meaningful way than I could otherwise. I have no intention of using this purely to strengthen my own views, but rather to expose these thoughts or ideas to the world and see what kind of critiques they may receive. Without this one runs the risk of becoming so entrenched in one’s own views that it leads to nothing but dogmatism and furthermore blind ignorance. I can’t promise a consistent schedule for my posts, unfortunately some things take considerably longer to write than others, but I do plan to try and keep this semi-regular. As of yet I have no comment function to receive feedback, but I will try and add one. Some posts may vary between German and English, I find some things easier to formulate in German and some things in English, it is usually dependant upon my source material. Unfortunately I am yet to find a reliable translate function for this page so for the time being a plug-in will have to be used. Thank you. <br><br>Posted 27.10.2025<br><br>
